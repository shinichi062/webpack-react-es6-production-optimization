Our example project is a React 0.14 web application utilizing ECMAScript 6 with a Babel 6 transpilation step through Webpack. You can simply clone the initial setup or run

npm i react react-dom --save
npm i babel babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 
babel-preset-react webpack --save-dev
These are all the necessary basics. Make sure you also have Webpack installed globally, which comes with the useful Webpack CLI

npm -g i webpack>
